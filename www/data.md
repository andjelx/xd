Email crosswords for comparison or inclusion to submit@xd.saul.pw (as attachments: .puz, .ipuz, .xd, .pdf, or .zip of any of these).  The filename should be the publication abbreviation (like 'nyt' or 'lat'; all full list is below), followed by the date, as nyt20161029.puz, for example, or pub-###.puz if they are numbered sequentially.   Incoming puzzles are processed once a day.

If you have more than 50 puzzles, please email me at [xd@saul.pw](mailto:xd@saul.pw) to discuss the best way to import and organize them.
